        <h2>I am Emmet Krohn</h2>
        <p>I started doing photography around the end of 2024, when I found mom's 2011 camera.</p>
        <p>Since then, I've been taking photos of nature, landscapes, animals, sports, or anything interesting I see.</p>
        <p>My favorite subjects are wildlife and landscapes, but I also heavily enjoy shooting track or other sports.</p>
        <p>I use a Canon EOS Rebel T3I with a 55-250mm f/4 lens, as well as a 14-25mm f/3.5 lens for wide shots.</p>
        <p>Recently I have picked up film photography as well, using a Canon EOS 650 as well as a recently purchased Pentax ME with a f/1.7 50mm lens.</p>
